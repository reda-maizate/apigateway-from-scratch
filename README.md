# Go Microservices Template

This repository is a template that contains an example of a back-end for a web application.

## Architecture

The back-end is composed of the following microservices:

- [**`auth`**](auth-service/README.md): The authentication and authorization service.
- [**`users`**](users-service/README.md): The users service.

## Getting Started

To add a new microservice, you can use the [**`microservice-template`**](microservice-template/README.md) repository as a starting point.
